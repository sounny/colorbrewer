<h1>ColorBrewer</h1>
<p>
ColorBrewer is a set of carefully designed color palettes for maps and other
graphics. It was originally created by cartographer Cynthia Brewer in the early
2000s at Pennsylvania State University to help mapmakers choose colors that
work well together, reproduce in print, and remain readable for people with
color-vision deficiencies. Over the years it has become a standard reference for
selecting sequential, diverging, and qualitative color schemes.
