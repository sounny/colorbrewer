## Annotated Bibliography

- **Brewer, C. A. (1997). Spectral schemes: Controversial color use on maps. *Cartography and Geographic Information Systems, 24*(4), 203–220. [PDF](Brewer_1997_Spectral_CaGIS.pdf)**
  - Discusses the debate over rainbow color schemes in thematic mapping. Presents research showing spectral schemes can be effective when treated as diverging schemes and adjusted for readers with color-vision impairments.

- **Brewer, C. A., & Pickle, L. (2002). Evaluation of methods for classifying epidemiological data on choropleth maps in series. *Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 92*(4), 662–681. [PDF](Brewer-2002-ClassifyingEpidemiologicalData.pdf)**
  - Compares seven classification techniques for mortality-rate maps. Finds quantile and minimum boundary error methods yield the most accurate map-reading results, with matched legends improving comparisons across map series.

- **Harrower, M., & Brewer, C. A. (2003). ColorBrewer.org: An online tool for selecting colour schemes for maps. *The Cartographic Journal, 40*(1), 27–37. [PDF](Harrower-2003-ColorBrewerTool.pdf)**
  - Introduces the ColorBrewer website, which guides users in choosing sequential, diverging, and qualitative color schemes. Describes considerations for map purpose, data type, and display medium, and provides exportable color specifications.

- **Harrower, M., & Brewer, C. A. (2003). ColorBrewer.org: An online tool for selecting colour schemes for maps (Web version). [PDF](Harrower-2003-ColorBrewerToolWeb.pdf)**
  - Web-focused version of the ColorBrewer tool paper, emphasizing online usability and accessibility for mapmakers.

- **Olson, J. M., & Brewer, C. A. (2004). An evaluation of color selections to accommodate map users with color-vision impairments. *Annals of the Association of American Geographers.* [PDF](Olson-2004-ColorVisionImpairments.pdf)**
  - Reports an experiment comparing color schemes for readers with red–green color-vision deficiencies. Maps designed with accommodating schemes improved accuracy and were preferred by affected users, though response times remained slower than those of users with normal vision.

- **Tickner, A. (2016). [Review of the book *Designing Better Maps: A Guide for GIS Users* (2nd ed.), by C. Brewer]. *Cartographic Perspectives, 84.* [PDF](Tickner-2016-DesigningBetterMapsReview.pdf)**
  - Reviews Brewer’s handbook on digital cartography. Highlights the concise coverage of map design principles—planning, base maps, labeling, color theory—and notes its practical tips for GIS professionals and students.
