Sounny's ColorBrewer
==============
This is built off of https://colorbrewer2.org/ and is a Web tool for guidance in choosing choropleth map color schemes, based on the research of [Dr. Cynthia Brewer](http://www.personal.psu.edu/cab38/). ColorBrezer2 is built and maintained by [Axis Maps](http://axismaps.com). This is Sounny's fork of ColorBrezer
