My ColorBrewer Fork
===================

This project is based on the original [ColorBrewer 2](https://colorbrewer2.org) project by Cynthia Brewer, Mark Harrower and Axis Maps at The Pennsylvania State University.

It provides the same color scheme selection tools but is an independent fork and is not endorsed by the original authors. Use it as a starting point for customizing your own color palettes.
