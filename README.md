# ColorBrewer Resources

This repository holds two ways to explore the ColorBrewer palettes. The
`version2/` directory preserves the classic ColorBrewer 2 web interface, while
`leaflet/` contains a lightweight Leaflet example that lets you apply the color
schemes to a simple map.

Open `index.html` at the project root for background information and links to
each version.
